👋 Hi, I’m Martin, a Full-Stack Javascript developer with 10+ years creative experience as a senior art director. Experienced in JavaScript(ES6), React, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Express, NodeJS, Figma and Adobe Creative Suite.
🎨 After many years working as a design professional, I'm curious to dig deeper into the technical side of building web applications.
I am excited to dive deep in multiple areas, and keen to look under the hood and learn new skills.
